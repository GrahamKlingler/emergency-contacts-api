# Emergency Contacts API

This API is for storing emergency contacts

## Setting up the project locally

To set up the project locally, clone the repository to your local machine. Since the SQLite3 file is in the repository, 
you should be able to use the database without initializing the database and performing migrations. Make sure Django is
installed on your machine or in your virtual environment. Then navigate to the outermost api_test folder.

To start the Django server locally:

If in a virtual environment, use:
### `manage.py runserver`

Otherwise, use:
### `python3 manage.py runserver`

This should open a port to your localhost, accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
